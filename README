Based on the Duet3D Smart Effector, see www.duet3d.com for the original Duet3D Smart Effector information. This reproduction/modification is not endorsed or supported in any way by Duet3D

This desing is meant for 24V only. 12V is possible with some modifications.
Changes from the original Smart Effector v3.0:
- Connectors heavily modified
- All cables from the Duet controller board on a single connector
- All cables from the effector on the same side of the board
- 6 illumination LEDs instead of 3.
- LEDs are 24V only. You can use 12V by soldering jumpers in place of 3 LEDs.
- Different regulator and amplifier to be easier to source.
- Works with the same firmware as Smart Effector v3.0.
